## Queues

## Hash Tables 

- Is used to uniquely identify a specific object - From a group of similar objects.
(for Example: In libraries, each book is assigned a unique number that can be used to determine information about the book, so books were hashed to a unique number ) 
- large keys are converted into small keys by using hash functions, The values are then stored in a data structure called hash table.
- Using Array to distribute entries (key/value pairs) uniformly.

 Big O :
- Each element is assigned a key (converted key). By using that key you can access the element in O(1) time.

## Sets 

- is an abstract data type that can store unique values, without any particular order.
- can be implemented using various data structures, which provide different time and space trade-offs for various operations.

 Big O :
- for sorted sets (which has O(log n) for most operations).

## Binary Trees 

## Tries

## Balancing Binary Trees (AVL Tree)
